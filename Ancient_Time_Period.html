                <h1>1. Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC)</h1>
                <p>
                    Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and the last active Hellenistic pharaoh. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean, which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).

                <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
                <p>
                    Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother,presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena),the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia. Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.

                <h1>Reign</h1>
                <p>
                   Ptolemy XII died before 22 March 51 BC, and Cleopatra began her reign by traveling to Hermonthis to install a sacred Buchis bull. She faced famine from drought, low Nile floods, lawless Gabiniani soldiers, and inherited debts of 17.5 million drachmas to Rome. In 50 BC, two sons of Marcus Bibulus were killed by the Gabiniani, possibly with help from rogue court officials. Cleopatra sent the culprits to Bibulus, who returned them and criticized her for interfering. By 29 August 51 BC, Cleopatra was listed as sole ruler, likely having married her brother Ptolemy XIII, following Ptolemaic sibling marriage traditions. Despite her rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII retained powerful allies, including the eunuch Potheinos, military commander Achillas, and tutor Theodotus of Chios. Cleopatra briefly tried to ally with Ptolemy XIV, but by 50 BC, Ptolemy XIII gained the upper hand, asserting dominance in official documents by 49 BC.

                <h2>Final Years / Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    After the defeat of her forces alongside Mark Antony by Octavian in 31 BC, Cleopatra committed suicide in 30 BC in Alexandria, traditionally believed to be by the bite of an asp. Her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Hellenistic era in Egypt, as the country became a Roman province. Cleopatra is remembered as one of history’s most influential female rulers, renowned for her intelligence, leadership, and impact on both Egyptian and Roman history.
