        <h1>1. Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC)</h1>
        <img src="cleoaura.webp" alt = "">
        <p> Queen of Egypt | Last Pharaoh | Member of the Ptolemaic Kingdom</p>
        <h2> Background</h2>
        <p>Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom 
            of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and the last active Hellenistic pharaoh.
             A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter,
             a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.
             Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, 
             among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean,
              which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).
        </p>   
        <h2>Origin</h2> 
        <p>Cleopatra, born in Alexandria as the daughter of Ptolemy XII,
           became ruler of Egypt in 51 BC alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII. Their conflict led to civil war. After Pompey fled to Egypt and was killed, Julius Caesar arrived,
           supported Cleopatra, and ended the siege against them. Ptolemy XIII died soon after, and Caesar made Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers. Cleopatra
           became Caesar’s lover and had a son, Caesarion. She later traveled to Rome until Caesar’s assassination. After Ptolemy XIV’s death, she made Caesarion co-ruler. Cleopatra 
           then formed a political and romantic alliance with Mark Antony, having three children with him. Antony relied heavily on her support during his military campaigns. Their 
           growing power angered Octavian, who declared war on Cleopatra. After losing the Battle of Actium and the invasion of Egypt, Antony killed himself, and Cleopatra took her
           own life to avoid humiliation by Octavian. Her legacy lived on through ancient writings and extensive artistic portrayals in Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, and modern culture,
           making her a lasting icon of history and popular culture.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
        <p>Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother,presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V 
           Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena),the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia.
           Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's 
           sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood
           tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.
        </p>
        <h2>Reign</h2>
        <p>Ptolemy XII died before 22 March 51 BC, and Cleopatra began her reign by traveling to Hermonthis to install a sacred Buchis bull. She faced famine from drought, low Nile floods, lawless
           Gabiniani soldiers, and inherited debts of 17.5 million drachmas to Rome. In 50 BC, two sons of Marcus Bibulus were killed by the Gabiniani, possibly with help from rogue court officials.
           Cleopatra sent the culprits to Bibulus, who returned them and criticized her for interfering. By 29 August 51 BC, Cleopatra was listed as sole ruler, likely having married her brother Ptolemy XIII,
           following Ptolemaic sibling marriage traditions. Despite her rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII retained powerful allies, including the eunuch Potheinos, military commander Achillas, and tutor Theodotus of Chios.
           Cleopatra briefly tried to ally with Ptolemy XIV, but by 50 BC, Ptolemy XIII gained the upper hand, asserting dominance in official documents by 49 BC.

        <h1>2. Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE)</h1>
        <img src="Julius-Caesar-statue.webp" alt="">
        <p>A Roman general and statesman who expanded the Roman Republic through military conquest.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Gaius Julius Caesar was a Roman general, statesman, and member of the First Triumvirate with Crassus and Pompey. He led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars, 
            extending Rome’s territory, and famously crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, starting a civil war that left him in near-total power.
            As dictator, Caesar carried out reforms, including creating the Julian calendar, settling veterans in colonies, expanding the Senate, 
            and granting citizenship to parts of Italy and Spain. In 44 BC, he was declared “dictator for life,” but was assassinated on the Ides of March by senators fearing his power.
            Caesar was also an accomplished writer and historian. His name became synonymous with “emperor,” inspiring titles like Kaiser and Tsar, and he remains one of history’s most famous military commanders.
        </p>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
           Julius Caesar (100 BC) was born into the patrician Julii family, which claimed descent from Julus, son of Aeneas, linking them to the goddess Venus. 
           Despite their noble ancestry, the family was not very politically influential during the middle Roman Republic.
           Caesar’s father, also named Gaius Julius Caesar, had moderate political success and married Aurelia Cotta, producing Caesar and two daughters. Caesar’s family connections, including his sister’s marriage to the powerful general Gaius Marius, 
           helped him gain early political opportunities, including service on a land commission and as praetor, and governor of Asia 
        </p>
        <h2>Life under Sulla and military service</h2>
        <p>
            During the dominance of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Caesar’s father retired from politics. Young Caesar was appointed flamen Dialis (priest of Jupiter),
             which could have prevented a political career, and married Cinna’s daughter, Cornelia. After his father’s sudden death in 84 BC, Caesar defied Sulla, 
             who had ordered him to divorce Cornelia and resign his priesthood. Caesar went into hiding but ultimately kept his wife by resigning the priesthood.
            Caesar then served abroad in Asia under governors Marcus Minucius Thermus and Publius Servilius Vatia, collecting naval forces in Bithynia and winning the civic crown at the Siege of 
            Mytilene for saving a citizen’s life. After Sulla’s death in 78 BC, Caesar returned to Rome, unsuccessfully prosecuting some Sullan aristocrats. He then went to Rhodes to study rhetoric under Apollonius Molon. 
            On the way, he was captured by pirates, ransomed, and later returned with a fleet to punish them. His studies were interrupted by the Third Mithridatic War, where he reportedly raised troops and fought successfully.
        </p>
        <h2>Entrance into politics</h2>
        <p>
            In 73 BC, Caesar was co-opted into the pontifices, marking him as a respected member of the aristocracy. 
            He returned to Rome and was elected military 
            tribune in 71 BC, advocating for the restoration of plebeian rights and pardons for Lepidus’ supporters.
            In 69 BC, Caesar became quaestor in Hispania Ulterior, earning a lifetime seat in the Senate. 
            Shortly before leaving, his aunt Julia and his wife Cornelia died; he gave public eulogies for both. 
            Caesar then remarried Pompeia, Sulla’s granddaughter, aligning with political norms of reconciliation.
