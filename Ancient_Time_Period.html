        <img src="cleoaura.webp" alt = "">
        <p> Queen of Egypt | Last Pharaoh | Member of the Ptolemaic Dynasty</p>
        <h2> Background</h2>
        <p>Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom 
            of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and the last active Hellenistic pharaoh.
             A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter,
             a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.
             Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, 
             among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean,
              which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).
        </p>   
        <h2>Origin</h2> 
        <p>Cleopatra, born in Alexandria as the daughter of Ptolemy XII,
           became ruler of Egypt in 51 BC alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII. Their conflict led to civil war. After Pompey fled to Egypt and was killed, Julius Caesar arrived,
           supported Cleopatra, and ended the siege against them. Ptolemy XIII died soon after, and Caesar made Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers. Cleopatra
           became Caesar’s lover and had a son, Caesarion. She later traveled to Rome until Caesar’s assassination. After Ptolemy XIV’s death, she made Caesarion co-ruler. Cleopatra 
           then formed a political and romantic alliance with Mark Antony, having three children with him. Antony relied heavily on her support during his military campaigns. Their 
           growing power angered Octavian, who declared war on Cleopatra. After losing the Battle of Actium and the invasion of Egypt, Antony killed himself, and Cleopatra took her
           own life to avoid humiliation by Octavian. Her legacy lived on through ancient writings and extensive artistic portrayals in Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, and modern culture,
           making her a lasting icon of history and popular culture.

        <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
        <p>Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother,[32][33][note 13] presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V 
           Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena),[34][35][36][note 14][note 2] the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia.
           Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.[40][41] The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's 
           sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator,[37][38][39] were born in the absence of his wife.[42][43] Cleopatra's childhood
           tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy.[44] During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.
        </p>
        <h2>Reign</h2>
        <p>Ptolemy XII died before 22 March 51 BC, and Cleopatra began her reign by traveling to Hermonthis to install a sacred Buchis bull. She faced famine from drought, low Nile floods, lawless
           Gabiniani soldiers, and inherited debts of 17.5 million drachmas to Rome. In 50 BC, two sons of Marcus Bibulus were killed by the Gabiniani, possibly with help from rogue court officials.
           Cleopatra sent the culprits to Bibulus, who returned them and criticized her for interfering. By 29 August 51 BC, Cleopatra was listed as sole ruler, likely having married her brother Ptolemy XIII,
           following Ptolemaic sibling marriage traditions. Despite her rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII retained powerful allies, including the eunuch Potheinos, military commander Achillas, and tutor Theodotus of Chios.
           Cleopatra briefly tried to ally with Ptolemy XIV, but by 50 BC, Ptolemy XIII gained the upper hand, asserting dominance in official documents by 49 BC.
