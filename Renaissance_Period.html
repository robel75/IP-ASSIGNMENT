        <h1>1. Leonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519)</h1>
        <p>
            Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath whose contributions spanned art, science, engineering, anatomy, and invention. Born in Vinci, Italy, he displayed extraordinary curiosity and talent from a young age. Leonardo painted masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, pioneering techniques in perspective, composition, and realism. Beyond art, he studied anatomy by dissecting human bodies, designed innovative machines, sketched engineering marvels, and explored principles of flight, hydraulics, and mechanics. His notebooks contain detailed drawings and scientific observations that were centuries ahead of their time. Leonardo’s integration of art and science, his relentless curiosity, and his inventive genius made him a quintessential Renaissance figure whose work continues to inspire creativity and discovery worldwide.

        <h1>2. Galileo Galilei (February 15, 1564 – January 8, 1642)</h1>
        <p>
            Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, and mathematician who played a key role in the scientific revolution. Born in Pisa, Italy, he made groundbreaking observations in astronomy, including the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the rough surface of the Moon using his improved telescope. Galileo championed the heliocentric model of the solar system, challenging prevailing geocentric beliefs, which led to conflict with the Catholic Church. He conducted important experiments in motion, gravity, and mechanics, laying the foundation for classical physics. Galileo’s rigorous approach to observation, experimentation, and mathematical description of natural phenomena revolutionized science. His writings and discoveries shaped modern scientific thought, inspiring generations of scientists to pursue evidence-based understanding of the universe.
