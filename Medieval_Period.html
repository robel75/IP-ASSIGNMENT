    <p>Genghis Khan (c. 1162 – 1227), born Temüjin, was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history.
       He is known for his military genius, unification of the Mongol tribes, and creation of an empire that spanned much of Asia and parts of Europe.
       His leadership, strategies, and administrative reforms had a profound and lasting impact on world history.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Genghis Khan was born around 1162 in the Mongolian steppes, into the Borjigin clan. His father, Yesügei, was a tribal chief, and his mother, Hoelun, played a crucial role in raising him after his father was poisoned by rival tribes.
       Temüjin grew up in a harsh environment marked by tribal warfare, scarcity, and political instability. Despite these challenges, he demonstrated early leadership qualities, intelligence, and resilience.
       He worked to build alliances and develop loyalty among his followers, skills that would later enable him to unify the Mongol tribes under his leadership.</p>

    <h2>Major Contributions / Career</h2>
    <p>Genghis Khan’s primary achievement was the unification of the Mongol tribes in 1206, after which he was proclaimed Genghis Khan, meaning "universal ruler."
       He implemented a merit-based system for leadership and military command, replacing the traditional aristocratic hierarchy.
       Genghis Khan led his armies in highly disciplined and innovative campaigns, conquering large territories in Central Asia, China, Persia, and Eastern Europe.
       He utilized strategies such as rapid cavalry movements, psychological warfare, and intelligence networks, which allowed his forces to defeat much larger armies.</p>

    <h2>Military Strategies and Governance</h2>
    <p>Genghis Khan is celebrated for his military genius and administrative reforms. He organized the Mongol army into units of tens, hundreds, and thousands, emphasizing discipline, mobility, and communication.
       He encouraged loyalty by promoting commanders based on merit rather than family ties. Beyond warfare, he implemented laws known as the Yassa, which regulated social conduct, military discipline, and governance across the empire.
       Genghis Khan also promoted trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange along the Silk Road, facilitating connections between East and West.</p>

    <h2>Final Years / Legacy</h2>
    <p>Genghis Khan died in 1227, likely during a military campaign, though the exact circumstances remain uncertain. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons and continued to expand under his successors.
