        <h1>1. Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955)</h1>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed an early curiosity for mathematics and science. He developed the theory of relativity, fundamentally transforming the understanding of space, time, and energy, and introduced the famous equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy. Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory, statistical mechanics, and cosmology, reshaping the foundations of physics. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Beyond his scientific work, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and global peace. His intellectual achievements and humanitarian efforts left a lasting legacy that continues to influence science, philosophy, and society.
