        <h1>1. Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955)</h1>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed an early curiosity for mathematics and science. He developed the theory of relativity, fundamentally transforming the understanding of space, time, and energy, and introduced the famous equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy. Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory, statistical mechanics, and cosmology, reshaping the foundations of physics. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Beyond his scientific work, Einstein was an outspoken advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and global peace. His intellectual achievements and humanitarian efforts left a lasting legacy that continues to influence science, philosophy, and society.

        <h1>2. Nelson Mandela (July 18, 1918 – December 5, 2013)</h1>
        <p>
            Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. Born in Mvezo, Mandela became a lawyer and joined the African National Congress (ANC), leading campaigns against racial segregation and discrimination. He was imprisoned for 27 years for his activism, becoming a global symbol of resistance to oppression. Following his release, Mandela negotiated with the government to dismantle apartheid and establish multiracial elections. As the first Black president of South Africa, he promoted reconciliation, nation-building, and social justice. Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and dedicated his life to human rights, equality, and education. His leadership, resilience, and moral vision made him one of the most admired and influential figures of modern history.
