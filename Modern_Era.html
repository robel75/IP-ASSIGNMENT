    They later moved to Munich, where Einstein spent his childhood. <br>
    Einstein Spoke slowly as a child (leading to the exaggerated myth of learning disabilities),
    Was introverted, thoughtful, and curious,Hated rigid schooling but loved math, science, and music,Learned
    violin from his mother, which became a lifelong love, Built mechanical devices and conducted simple experiments
   </p>

   <h3>Education</h3>
   <p>
    At age 15, Einstein Clashed with Germany’s authoritarian school system,Left Munich to join his family in Italy
    Renounced his German citizenship at 16 (to avoid military service),
    <h5>Swiss Education</h5>
     He applied to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (ETH) in Zurich in 1895.
     Though he failed all subjects except math and physics, the school let him enroll after completing high school in Aarau, Switzerland.
    <h5>At ETH Zurich (1896–1900)</h5>
    Einstein studied:
    <ul>
     <li>Physics</li>
     <li>Mathematics</li>
     <li>Electromagnetism</li>
     <li>Advanced calculus</li>
    <li>Mechanics</li>
     </ul>
    He graduated in 1900 but wasn’t seen as an obedient or promising student.
    Professors disliked his independent attitude, so he couldn’t get a job in academia.In 1902, with help from a friend, he secured a job as a technical assistant
    (patent examiner) at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
    While working full-time, Einstein completed a PhD and published four revolutionary papers in the journal Annalen der Physik, reshaping modern physics:
    <ul>
    <li>Photoelectric Effect – introduced the idea of light quanta (photons), laying foundations for quantum theory.</li>
    <li>Brownian Motion – provided empirical proof for atoms.</li>
    <li>Special Theory of Relativity – showed time and space are relative and introduced the concept of spacetime.</li>
    <li>Mass–Energy Equivalence – from relativity came the famous equation E = mc².</li>
    </ul>
    These works are collectively known as the Annus Mirabilis Pa

    <h2>Nelson Mandela</h2>
    <img src = "Nelson Mandela.jpg" alt = "Nelson Mandela">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, a small village in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. He belonged to the Madiba clan of the Xhosa-speaking Thembu people, a royal lineage. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a chief and councilor to the Thembu king. His mother, Nonqaphi Nosekeni, was one of the chief's four wives.
            Mandela’s birth name, Rolihlahla, roughly translates to “troublemaker”, a name that would later take on symbolic meaning in his political life. After his father’s death when he was nine years old, Mandela was placed under the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo, who raised him in the royal household at Mqhekezweni.
            Growing up, Mandela listened to the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ brave resistance to colonial rule, planting in him a lifelong yearning for justice and freedom.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Education and Political Awakening</h3>
        <p>
         Mandela was the first in his family to attend school, where a teacher gave him the English name Nelson. He completed his secondary education at Healdtown, a Methodist school known for strict discipline and quality teaching.
         He then enrolled at the University of Fort Hare, one of the few higher-education institutions available to Black South Africans at the time. At Fort Hare, his political awareness began to grow. He was suspended for participating in a student protest against university policies.
         To avoid a forced marriage arranged by his guardian, Mandela fled to Johannesburg in 1941, working as a night watchman and later as a law clerk. He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree by correspondence through the University of South Africa (UNISA).
         In 1943, he began studying law at the University of Witwatersrand, where he was one of the few Black students and encountered future anti-apartheid activists.
         <br>
         In 1944, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC), helping to found its Youth League (ANCYL) to encourage a more radical and confrontational approach to oppressive government policies.

        <h4>Arrest and the Rivonia Trial (1964)</h4>
        In 1962, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to 5 years for leaving the country illegally. During police raids, documents linking him to MK activities were discovered, leading to the Rivonia Trial.

    <h2>Winston Churchill</h2>
    <img src = "Winston Churchill 1941.webp" alt = "Winston Churchill">
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England.
        <ul>
        He came from an aristocratic family:
        <li>His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a prominent Conservative politician.</li>
        <li>His mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite from a wealthy New York family.</li>
        </ul>
        Churchill grew up in a household where political discussion and elite society were constant influences. Despite this, his early academic career was unimpressive. He struggled in traditional school settings but excelled in subjects that captured his imagination, such as English, history, and writing.
      <h4>Harrow School</h4>
       At age 12, he was admitted to Harrow, one of Britain's most prestigious boarding schools. He was not known for discipline but was recognized for his strong memory and linguistic talent.
       <h4>Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst</h4>
       After several attempts, he passed the entrance exam for Sandhurst and trained as a cavalry officer. In 1895, Churchill graduated 20th out of 130 cadets and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen’s Own Hussars.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Early Political Career</h3>

        Churchill entered Parliament in 1900 as a Conservative MP but soon switched to the Liberal Party over disagreements about tariffs and free trade.
        <h4>Positions Held:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (1906–1908)</li>
        <li>President of the Board of Trade (1908–1910)</li>
        <li>Home Secretary (1910–1911)</li>
        <li>First Lord of the Admiralty (1911–1915)</li>

        <li>Social welfare programs</li>
        <li>Improvements in working conditions</li>
        <li>Modernization of the Royal Navy, including transitioning from coal to oil-powered ships.</li>
        </ul>
     World War I
     His biggest setback came with the Gallipoli Campaign (1915), a failed naval operation. Public criticism forced him to resign from the Admiralty.<br>
     He briefly served on the Western Front as a battalion commander before returning to government.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Wilderness Years (1929-1939)</h3>
    <p>
        From 1929 onward, Churchill’s political influence declined. He took strong and unpopular positions, including:
        <ul>
        <li>Opposing Indian independence</li>
        <li>Warning against the rise of Nazi Germany</li>
        <li>Criticizing appeasement policies </li>
        </ul>
        Many in Parliament considered him outdated, but his warnings about Hitler would soon prove prophetic.
        During these years, he devoted himself to writing, producing historical works that earned great respect.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>World War 2 and Leadership</h3>
    <p>
        When Neville Chamberlain resigned in 1940 after the collapse of the Norway campaign, Churchill became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
        <br><q>The Greatest Briton</q><br>
        His speeches, radio broadcasts, and defiant spirit galvanized Britain during its darkest hours:
        <ul>
        <li>Battle of Britain</li>
        <li>Blitz bombings</li>
        <li>Threat of invasion</li>
        <li>>Struggle against Nazi Germany</li>

        <li>Franklin D. Roosevelt (United States)</li>
        <li>Joseph Stalin (Soviet Union)</li>
        </ul>
        His leadership helped shape the strategy that led to Allied victory in Europe in 1945.
        However, despite winning the war, he lost the 1945 general election, as Britons chose a Labour government focused on domestic reform.
