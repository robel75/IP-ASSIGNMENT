        <h2>Bill Gates</h2>
        <img src = "./assets/Bill Gates.webp" alt = "Bill Gates">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            William Henry Gates III, widely known as Bill Gates, was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, USA. He grew up in an upper-middle-class family. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a prominent attorney, and his mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a schoolteacher, businesswoman, and the first female director of First Interstate Bank and United Way International.
          Gates displayed early brilliance in mathematics and logical thinking. At age 13, he enrolled in the elite Lakeside School, which had a computer terminal—rare at the time. Gates became fascinated with programming, often spending long hours coding and experimenting.
          He wrote his first computer program—a simple tic-tac-toe game—on a GE computer at age 13. There, he met Paul Allen, who would later become his Microsoft co-founder. Together, Gates, Allen, and a few friends formed the “Lakeside Programmers Club,” taking on real programming jobs for local companies while still in school.
          By age 17, Gates and Allen developed a traffic-counting software called “Traf-O-Data,” earning their first entrepreneurial experience.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University, where he studied pre-law briefly but then switched to mathematics and computer science. At Harvard, he befriended Steve Ballmer (future Microsoft CEO) and spent much of his time programming.
            In 1974, Gates and Allen discovered the Altair 8800, one of the earliest personal computers. Seeing its commercial potential, they developed a BASIC interpreter for the machine. Their success convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard in 1975 to pursue a business career.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Founding and Building Microsoft</h3>
        <p>
            In 1975, Gates and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Their vision was to place “a computer on every desk and in every home.” Microsoft initially licensed its BASIC interpreter and later expanded into operating systems.
            <h4>Major Milestones at Microsoft</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1980: Microsoft struck a deal with IBM to provide an operating system. Gates purchased QDOS for $50,000, modified it, and delivered it as MS-DOS, which became the industry standard.</li>
                <li>1985: Microsoft launched Windows 1.0, introducing a graphical user interface.</li>
                <li>1990: Release of Windows 3.0, a major commercial success.</li>
                <li>1995: Launch of Windows 95, one of the most influential operating systems in history.</li>
                <li>Late 1990s: Microsoft dominated the PC software industry, leading to antitrust investigations in the U.S. and Europe.</li>
                <li>2000: Gates stepped down as CEO, becoming chief software architect while Ballmer became CEO.</li>
            </ul>
            Gates became a billionaire at age 31 and the world’s richest man multiple times due to Microsoft’s success.
