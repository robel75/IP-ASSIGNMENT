        <p>
            <b>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931)</b>
             was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many
              devices in fields such as electric power generation, sound recording,
              and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph,
               the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light
               bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world.
               He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science
                and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees.
                He established the first industrial research laboratory.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854.
             He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy
             Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in Chenango County, New York).
             His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey.Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother,
             a former school teacher. He attended school for only a few months,
             but was a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own.
             Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. Historian Paul Israel
              attributed the cause of his deafness to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear
              infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness. He was completely deaf
              in one ear and barely hearing in the other. Edison later listened to a music player or
             piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Phonograph</h3>
        <p>
            The invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. He vigorously stirred up public awareness for this new
             invention by engaging with journalists and performing public demonstrations. The phonograph was so unexpected by the public at large
              as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park".[39] As he aged, he grew to resent titles representing
               him as a genius, and he emphasized "one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.

             His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times,
             the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US,
              described Edison as "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other". In April 1878, Edison demonstrated the phonograph before the National Academy
              of Sciences. Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter
               produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.

        <h3>Electric Light</h3>
        <p>
            In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination that he could deploy in a large-scale commercial utility, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting.
             Key to his system would be developing a durable low resistance incandescent lamp, essential for a wide-scale indoor lighting system. There had been many incandescent lamps devised by inventors prior to Edison,
              but these early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate, which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison first tried using a filament
              made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo
               as the best filament.

            He addressed lighting as a system.Solving it took experimental research; market research, with Grosvenor Lowrey that included forging connections with powerful investors, viewing a mechanical electric generator, and planning power
             distribution; and grand public statements to promote his work. Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family.

        <h3>Final Years</h3>
        <p>
            Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924.
            Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated.The trips functioned as a moving advertisement for Ford cars, Firestone tires, and whatever Edison had going on at the time. A team of reporters joined to ensure word spread.

         In 1926, at 79 years old, Edison handed over the presidency of Thomas A. Edison, Inc. to Charles.

        Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this
        service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken
        in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.
        In the final years of his life, Edison continued to chew tobacco daily and his diabetes worsened.
         Edison died on October 18, 1931, at Glenmont and was buried on the property.

        <h2>2. Nikola Tesla</h2>
        <img src = "./assets/Nikola Tesla 1890 Background Removed.png" alt = "">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July 1856 in the village of Smiljan, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia) into an ethnic Serb family. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.
             His father's brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.

         Tesla's mother, Georgina "Đuka" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education.
          Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.

         Tesla was the fourth of five children. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.
         In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual
         throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.Tesla's family did not hear from him after he left school. There was a rumor among his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby river Mur but in January one of them ran into Tesla in
         the town of Maribor and reported that encounter to Tesla's family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month.
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            Graz University of Technology (1875–1878)

               Tesla enrolled on a military scholarship and studied:
               <ul>
               <li>Physics</li>

               <li>Electrical engineering</li>

               <li>Mathematics</li>

               <li>Mechanics</li>
               </ul>
            At Graz, he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which could work as both a generator and motor—this sparked his vision of the AC motor.
            He was a top student initially but eventually dropped out before completing his degree.

             Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague (1880)

             He briefly attended this university, though he never formally enrolled due to arriving late.
             Instead, he attended lectures informally
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Coming to America</h3>
        <p>
            Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 with only a few coins and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison.

           He famously said:

           <q>I didn’t bring much—just the greatest invention of mankind.</q>

          Edison immediately employed Tesla at Edison Machine Works in New York.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Tesla vs Edison: The War of Currents</h3>
        <p>
          <h5>Edison’s DC vs Tesla’s AC</h5>

          Edison promoted Direct Current (DC) power systems.

         Tesla advocated Alternating Current (AC), which allowed electricity to be transmitted over long distances efficiently.

        Their Conflict:
        <ul>
        <li>Edison allegedly promised Tesla $50,000 to improve DC generators, then refused to pay.
        Tesla resigned, later teaming up with George Westinghouse, who believed in AC.
        </li>
         </ul>
        <h5>AC Triumph</h5>

       Tesla’s AC system won the War of Currents.

       The Niagara Falls Power Station (1895) used Tesla’s AC generators and became the world’s first large-scale hydroelectric system.

       AC became the global standard for electrical power.

          <h4>1.AC Induction Motor (1888)</h4>
          A breakthrough electric motor that made widespread use of electricity possible.
          <h4>2.Polyphase AC System</h4>
          Enabled efficient long-distance power transmission.
          <h4>3.Tesla Coil (1891)</h4>
          A high-voltage resonant transformer still used in radio, TV, wireless tech, and demonstrations today.
          <h4>4.Radio Technology</h4>
          Tesla demonstrated wireless radio communication before Marconi.
          In 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court credited Tesla as the inventor of radio.
          <h4>5.Remote Control</h4>
          In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled robotic boat, the first ever.
        </p>
        <h3>Death(1943)</h3>
        <p>
            Tesla died alone on January 7, 1943, in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel.
            Cause of death: coronary thrombosis (a heart attack).

            He was 86 years old.

            After his death:
            <ul>
            <li>The FBI ordered his papers seized, though most were later returned to his family.</li>

            <li>His work remains important in modern electrical engineering and wireless technology.</li>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, in Trier, a city in the Kingdom of Prussia (modern-day Germany).
            His birth took place during a time of political repression following the defeat of Napoleon, when Prussia was clamping down on liberal and revolutionary ideas.

           <h6>Family Background:</h6>
           <ul>
           <li><b>Father – Heinrich Marx</b></li>
           A successful lawyer, originally Jewish but converted to Lutheran Christianity in 1816 to keep his profession after anti-Jewish laws were enacted. He was a rationalist, Enlightenment thinker, and admirer of Voltaire.

          <li><b>Mother – Henriette Pressburg</b></li>
          Came from a wealthy Dutch Jewish business family. She was religious, warm, and practical.

       <h3>Education and Intellectual Development</h3>
       <p>
        <h5>University of Bonn (1835–1836)</h5>

        At 17, Marx enrolled in the University of Bonn, initially to study law.
       There, he:
       <ul>
       <li>Became involved in student politics</li>

       <li>Joined a drinking club</li>

       <li>Got into conflicts and even a duel</li>

       <li>Neglected his studies</li>
       </ul>
      His father, worried about Marx’s unruly behavior, moved him to a more disciplined university.

      <h5>University of Berlin (1836–1841)</h5>

      Marx transferred to the University of Berlin, where he encountered:
      <ul>
      <li>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s philosophy, which deeply shaped his thinking.</li>

      <li>A group known as the Young Hegelians, radical philosophers who criticized religion, monarchy, and Prussian society.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Theological and Philosophical Influences</h5>
     <ul>
    <li> Hegel: history moves through dialectical conflict</li>

    <li> Feuerbach: religion is a projection of human needs </li>

     <li>Young Hegelians: sought to challenge existing institutions</li>

     Marx became heavily involved in philosophical debates and abandoned law to pursue philosophy and history.
     </ul>
     <h5>Doctoral Thesis (1841)</h5>

     Marx completed his PhD dissertation:
     "The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature"

     It was a deep, abstract philosophical work.
     He intended to become a university professor, but rising government censorship made academic careers for radicals nearly impossible.

        <h2>Charles Darwin</h2>
        <img src = "./assets/Charles Darwin Background Removed.png" alt="Charles Darwin">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Charles Robert Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, in Shrewsbury, England, into a wealthy and well-educated family.
        <h5>Family Background</h5>
        <ul>
        <b>Father – Dr. Robert Darwin</b>
        <li>A successful physician, very tall, influential, and financially comfortable.</li>
        <b>Mother – Susannah Wedgwood</b>
        <li>Member of the famous Wedgwood pottery family—affluent, intellectual, and progressive.</li>
        </ul>
        Darwin grew up in a prosperous environment that encouraged curiosity and learning.From a young age Darwin
        Loved collecting beetles, rocks, shells, and specimens ("a born naturalist"),
        Was fascinated with animals, often observing birds and insects,
        Had a strong passion for outdoor exploration,
       Performed early experiments with chemistry (earning the nickname “Gas” from his classmates).But academically,
       His handwriting was poor,He disliked rote learning,Teachers often saw him as average or unfocused.
       Yet his curiosity and observational skills were already forming the foundation of his future discoveries.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>University of Edinburgh (1825–1827)</h5>
        At age 16, Darwin was sent to Edinburgh to study medicine, following family tradition.
        Why Edinburgh Didn’t Work
       Darwin Found lectures boring,Could not handle the sight of surgery (performed without anesthesia at the time),Skipped classes and went exploring tidal pools and seasides instead,
       <h5>Influences at Edinburgh</h5>
       <ul>
       <li><b>Robert Grant (a marine biologist)</b> introduced Darwin to advanced evolutionary ideas, including Lamarck’s early theories.</li>
       <li>Darwin learned taxidermy from a freed Afro-Caribbean slave named John Edmonstone, a skilled naturalist.</li>
       <li>Darwin decided he did not want to be a doctor.</li>
       He graduated with a BA in 1831.
       </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Development of the Theory of Evolution</h3>
        <p>
            After reading Thomas Malthus’s Essay on Population, Darwin realized:
            <q>Species evolve through natural selection—those with advantageous traits survive and reproduce.</q>
            He spent over 20 years gathering evidence before publishing.
            <h5>Alfred Russel Wallace (1858)</h5>
            Wallace independently developed a similar theory while in Malaysia.
            He sent Darwin a manuscript, unknowingly pushing Darwin to finally publish.
            Darwin and Wallace presented their ideas jointly, but Darwin’s evidence was far more extensive.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Personal Life, Health Struggles, and Faith</h3>
        <p>
            Darwin suffered lifelong health problems:
            <ul>
             <li>Chronic nausea</li>
             <li>Heart palpitations</li>
             <li>Digestive issues</li>
             <li>Fainting spells</li>
             <li>Possibly Chagas disease or severe anxiety</li>
             </ul>
             He lived mostly as a semi-invalid.
             <h5>Religion</h5>
               Darwin started as a Christian but gradually became agnostic.
               He rejected harsh religious doctrines but respected moral values.
               He avoided public attacks on religion, but his theory deeply challenged traditional beliefs.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>Charles Darwin died on April 19, 1882, at age 73, at his home in Down House.
          Cause: likely heart failure.
          He was buried in Westminster Abbey, near Isaac Newton—an incredible honor for a naturalist once considered a heretic by many.
