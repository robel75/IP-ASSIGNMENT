        <h1>1. Thomas Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931)</h1>
        <p>
            Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor, scientist, and businessman, widely regarded as one of history’s most prolific inventors. Born in Milan, Ohio, Edison showed an early interest in mechanics and experimentation, often conducting science experiments at home and selling newspapers and candy to support his ventures. Despite limited formal schooling, he became self-educated, developing skills in telegraphy and electrical engineering. Edison held over 1,000 patents for inventions including the phonograph, motion picture camera, and the practical electric light bulb, which transformed daily life around the world. He established the first industrial research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, pioneering organized scientific research and collaboration. Edison’s innovations revolutionized communication, entertainment, and energy distribution, laying the groundwork for modern electric power systems and industrial technology. Beyond invention, Edison was a savvy entrepreneur, founding General Electric, and influencing the commercialization of science and technology. His work left a profound impact on the modern industrialized world and the course of technological advancement.

        <h1>2. Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 – January 7, 1943)</h1>
        <p>
            Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, known for his groundbreaking work in alternating current (AC) electricity and electromagnetic fields. Born in Smiljan, in modern-day Croatia, Tesla displayed extraordinary intelligence and memory from a young age. He studied engineering and physics in Europe before moving to the United States, where he worked with Thomas Edison before striking out independently. Tesla’s inventions and theoretical work include the development of AC power systems, induction motors, transformers, wireless transmission of energy, radio technology, and pioneering experiments in electromagnetism. Despite facing financial difficulties and intense competition, particularly with Edison during the “War of Currents,” Tesla’s visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern electrical power distribution, radio, and wireless communication. He spent his later years in New York City, continuing his research on wireless transmission, robotics, and renewable energy, leaving a legacy as one of the most innovative and enigmatic figures in science and technology.

        <h1>3. Karl Marx (May 5, 1818 – March 14, 1883)</h1>
        <p>
            Karl Marx was a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier, Prussia, Marx studied law and philosophy at university, developing a critical understanding of society, politics, and economics. Together with Friedrich Engels, he co-authored "The Communist Manifesto," advocating for the working class and analyzing the dynamics of capitalism, class struggle, and historical materialism. Marx’s seminal work, "Das Kapital," examined the political economy of capitalism, the exploitation of labor, and the social relations underpinning production. His theories laid the intellectual foundation for socialism and communism, influencing revolutionary movements and shaping political discourse across Europe and beyond. Despite facing exile, poverty, and censorship during his life, Marx continued writing, researching, and advocating for social change until his death in London. His ideas remain influential, debated, and implemented in various forms around the world.
