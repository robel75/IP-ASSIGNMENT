    <h1>Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727)</h1>
    <img src="./assets/isaac_newton Background Removed.png">
    <p>Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and philosopher, widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history.
       He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the foundation for classical mechanics and revolutionizing our understanding of the natural world.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.
       His father died before his birth, and he was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother.
       Newton attended the King’s School in Grantham and later Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
       He was deeply curious, conducting experiments in optics, motion, and mathematics, and often working independently to explore the laws of nature.</p>

    <h2>Major Contributions / Career</h2>
    <p>Newton made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and science.
       He developed calculus independently, formulated the three laws of motion, and established the law of universal gravitation.
       He conducted pioneering experiments in optics, discovering that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors and inventing the reflecting telescope.
       Newton’s work “Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica” (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) laid the mathematical foundation for physics and shaped scientific inquiry for centuries.</p>

    <h2>Scientific Impact</h2>
    <p>Newton’s discoveries transformed our understanding of the universe, providing a framework to explain the motion of planets, projectiles, and objects on Earth.
       His methods emphasized observation, experimentation, and mathematical description, influencing generations of scientists and mathematicians.
       Newton also served as Master of the Royal Mint and President of the Royal Society, contributing to public service and scientific administration.</p>

    <h2>Final Years / Legacy</h2>
    <p>Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727, in London.
       He is remembered as a towering figure in science whose work established principles still fundamental in physics and mathematics.
       Newton’s discoveries shaped modern scientific thought, inspiring further exploration of the natural world and cementing his legacy as one of history’s greatest intellectuals.</p>

    <h1>Christopher Columbus (1451 – 1506)</h1>
    <img src="./assets/christopher_columbus Background Removed.png">
    <p>Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and navigator credited with opening the Americas to European exploration.
       Sponsored by Spain, his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean connected Europe and the New World, altering the course of history and global trade.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Columbus was born in 1451 in Genoa, Italy, into a family of wool weavers.
       He began sailing at an early age, gaining experience in navigation, cartography, and seamanship.
       Columbus developed a belief that the Earth was round and that a westward voyage could reach Asia.
       Despite initial skepticism, he sought funding for his expedition to find a western route to Asia, ultimately gaining support from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain.</p>

    <h2>Major Contributions / Voyages</h2>
    <p>In 1492, Columbus embarked on his first voyage with three ships: the Niña, Pinta, and Santa María.
       He reached islands in the Caribbean, believing he had found a new route to Asia.
       Columbus undertook three subsequent voyages, exploring parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.
       His voyages initiated sustained European exploration and colonization of the Americas, connecting continents and transforming global trade and cultural exchange.</p>

    <h2>Impact and Controversy</h2>
    <p>Columbus’s voyages expanded European geographic knowledge, opened trade routes, and led to the establishment of colonies.
       However, his expeditions also resulted in the exploitation, enslavement, and suffering of indigenous populations.
       Columbus remains a controversial figure, celebrated for exploration and criticized for the negative consequences of colonization.</p>

    <h2>Final Years / Legacy</h2>
    <p>Christopher Columbus died on May 20, 1506, in Valladolid, Spain.
       He is remembered as a pioneering navigator whose voyages reshaped global history.
       His journeys sparked the Age of Exploration, fundamentally changing world trade, migration, and cultural exchange, and leaving a complex and lasting legacy.</p>
