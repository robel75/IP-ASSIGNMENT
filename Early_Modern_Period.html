        <h1>1. Isaac Newton (January 4, 1643 – March 31, 1727)</h1>
        <p>
            Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author, widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history. Born prematurely in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, Newton faced early hardships, including the death of his father before his birth and his mother remarrying when he was young. Despite these challenges, he developed a fascination for mathematics, physics, and natural philosophy. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he studied and later taught, producing groundbreaking work in mathematics and science. Newton formulated the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, explaining the motion of celestial and terrestrial objects. His work in optics included experiments with prisms, the study of light and color, and the development of theories about reflection and refraction. In mathematics, he co-developed calculus, providing powerful tools for analysis and problem-solving. Newton’s "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," published in 1687, laid the foundation for classical mechanics and revolutionized scientific thought. Beyond academia, he served as Warden and then Master of the Royal Mint, reformed currency, and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705. He continued his studies in alchemy, theology, and science until his death in 1727, leaving a legacy that profoundly influenced physics, astronomy, mathematics, and the way humans understand the universe.

        <h1>2. Christopher Columbus (1451 – May 20, 1506)</h1>
        <p>
            Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and navigator whose transatlantic voyages opened the Americas to European exploration and colonization. Born in Genoa, Italy, Columbus developed an early passion for the sea, navigation, and discovery. He gained experience sailing in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, studying mapmaking, astronomy, and maritime techniques. In 1492, he convinced King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to fund a westward voyage to reach Asia. Instead, Columbus landed in the Bahamas, believing he had found islands near Asia, marking the beginning of sustained European contact with the Americas. Over his four voyages, he explored parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. Despite facing hardships, political disputes, and criticism, Columbus’s expeditions initiated a lasting cultural and economic exchange between the Old and New Worlds, known as the Columbian Exchange. His achievements reshaped global trade, navigation, and geopolitics. Columbus died in 1506 still believing he had reached Asia, leaving a controversial but undeniable mark on world history, celebrated as a bold explorer while also criticized for the impact of European colonization on indigenous peoples.

        <h1>3. Martin Luther (November 10, 1483 – February 18, 1546)</h1>
        <p>
            Martin Luther was a German theologian, priest, and seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Born in Eisleben, Germany, Luther studied at a Latin school and the University of Erfurt, originally intending to pursue law. A life-changing experience during a thunderstorm led him to join the Augustinian monastery, dedicating himself to religious study and spiritual discipline. He questioned the practices of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the sale of indulgences, and in 1517, famously nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church. This act sparked theological debates that spread across Europe, leading to the establishment of Protestant denominations. Luther translated the Bible into German, making it accessible to the general population, advocated for education and literacy, and wrote extensively on theology and church reform. Despite facing excommunication, political opposition, and threats to his life, Luther’s teachings endured and reshaped the religious, cultural, and political landscape of Europe. He died in 1546 in Eisleben, leaving a legacy as one of the most influential reformers in Western history, whose ideas about faith, scripture, and conscience continue to impact Christianity today.
